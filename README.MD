# The Classic Pack

The Classic Pack(TCP) is a continuation of the popular Minecraft modpack 'Tekkit Classic'. The purpose of the pack is to provide an updated yet nostalgic experience to users who have used the pack in the past.
Due to the nature of the included mods, TCP is a great place for Minecraft modded survival beginners to get to grips with some of the mods that started it all!

Here is what you should expect from this Github!
  - Current available builds for the official TCP pack 
  - A documentation section that will eventually grow into a community driven guide repo
  - The potential to make your own changes to the pack for submission and review
### Getting started

TCP runs via Minecraft's native libraries and requires [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) to run.

It is imperative that you have the Java version downloaded that your system uses for optimised performance. (64bit systems should use 64bit java and so forth) This is especially important if you wish to host a server yourself!
>The TCP pack is primarily hosted and supposed to be run via [The Technic Launcher](https://www.technicpack.net/download)
>Simply install the launcher, sign in with your Minecraft credentials and search for The Classic Pack on the browser.
